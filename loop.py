# In this example, we first define a PyTorch implementation of the DQN network with 
# two fully connected layers and a final output layer for the action space. 
# We also define a replay buffer to store experiences during training, 
# and an agent class that contains the DQN model, target model, optimizer, and loss function.
# We then simulate the TDD time slots in 5G NR using a list of binary values. For each episode, 
# we initialize the state randomly and loop through the time slots, 
# choosing an action using an epsilon-greedy policy, 
# simulating the next state and reward, and adding the experience to the replay buffer. 
# We then train the agent on a batch of experiences, 
# update the target network every 10 time slots, and terminate the episode if the time slot is
